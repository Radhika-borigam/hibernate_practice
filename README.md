# Hibernate Practice Project

This repository contains my **learning journey** and practice projects with **Hibernate**, a popular Java framework for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## ðŸ“Œ Why Hibernate is Important

Hibernate plays a crucial role in Java development by simplifying the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It reduces the complexity of writing SQL queries directly by mapping Java objects to database tables, allowing developers to focus more on business logic than database plumbing.

Through learning Hibernate, I have understood how it:

- Eliminates the need for repetitive JDBC code.
- Provides a consistent and database-independent query language (HQL).
- Supports automatic table creation and schema management.
- Efficiently manages database sessions and transactions.
- Improves application performance with caching.

## ðŸ“š What I Have Learned

By working on this project, I have gained hands-on experience with:

- Setting up Hibernate configurations and Maven dependencies.
- Creating entity classes and mapping them to database tables using annotations.
- Connecting to MySQL databases and managing connections.
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Hibernate sessions.
- Understanding how transactions work and how to manage them.
- Using Hibernate Query Language (HQL) for querying data.
